    //TODO 1. consider the configuration for SM and Apache
    //TODO 2. Use Java to call keytool to import, export, delete related command
    //TODO 3. check the password for all the certificate, need to consider to take SM to the default
    //TODO 4. put the related pamater into properties file
    //TODO 5. check if the handshake method is needed
    //TODO 6. exception handler
    //TODO 7. ParameterType
    //TODO 8. Need to consider adding CAC validation. this should be implemented in phase 2
    //TODO 9. there is properties file, user can specify what certificate they want to generate and the order
    //TODO 10. if customer doesn't know what the alias of certificate is, how many certificates are in keystore, is it possible to check by program
    //TODO for example, first use keytool list to list all the certificate and then analyze each parameter and value. need to check if it can be done or not.
    //TODO 11. after generating SM TSO certificate, need to generate a txt file which contains the configuration same as in sm.ini. This is needed as
    //TODO the certificates are generated by program, user can not remember or get the related password.
    //TODO use java to analyze the certificate and get the single information
